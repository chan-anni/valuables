## High Level Goal
- Develop front end to backend map feature which allows user to see lost items as pins on the map, and report lost and found items for Beta Release.

## Original Goals
- Familiarize with Supabase and Flutter (~1 week)
- Integrate Google Maps API (~1 day)
- Provide basic functional map navigation (~1 day)
- Fetch backend data and display it as interactive map pins/listings (~3 days)
- Enable pin to listing navigation (click on the pin, and it maps to the listing) (~4 days)

## Progress and Issues
- Familiarized ourselves with some Flutter and Supabase. We're still getting used to the widgets on Flutter, and table management with Supabase.
- We were able to integrate the Google Maps API, so a map appears. As of currently, it only works for android and we need to figure out the ios part.
- Designed the needed properties for our database tables
- Determined required architecure for app

## Goals for Next Week
- Finish map requirements (adding listings show up) (~2 days)
- Write some unit tests + continuous integration tests for forms (4 days)
- Conenct data base with app (1 day)
- get map API to work with ios
