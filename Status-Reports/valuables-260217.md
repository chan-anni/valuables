## High Level Goal
- Integrate the Home, Map, and Profile interface. Allow user to navigate through the app and login with their account.

## Original Goals
- Implement photo taking/uploading
- Tie in the photo part with the reporting forms
- Requires testing of found item and photo taking
- Enable adding new reports to public map
- Include “claim order” to get claim tickets for a found item 


## Progress and Issues
- The user can select their pictures of the item, but the whole form data is not being uploaded yet to the supabase
- Integration of interfaces went well, the app is more complete with different pages now
- The messages tabs hasn't been implemented.
- User can chose to create an account with email and password or login with Google

## Goals for Next Week
- Begin in app chatting feature (-6 days)
- Refine the interface
- Improve items and map interaction and integration (display uploaded items and link maps pins to items' page)
