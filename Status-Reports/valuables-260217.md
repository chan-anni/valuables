#  Valuables 26/02/17

## High Level Goal
- Integrate the Home, Map, and Profile interface. Allow user to navigate through the app and login with their account. Update UI for gamma release.

## Original Goals
- Fix/add the image storage system links and map connection to the form (~2/3 days)
- Begin in app chatting feature (-6 days)
- Clean up UI for beta release by giving everything labels and finalizing formatting (~4 days)
- Write 5 more integration tests, which will include having inputted items being put into a backend (2 days)


## Progress and Issues
- The user can select their pictures of the item and the form data uploads into the backend properly.
- Integration of interfaces went well, the app is more complete with different pages now.
- The messages tabs hasn't been implemented. This got pushed back since we were instead focusing on integrating components and had some struggles with that.
- We wrote more tests but they mostly go through UI and interacting with the components. 
- User can chose to create an account with email and password or login with Google. There are some UI issues to fix with sign in as it's not easy to determine what to put where.

## Goals for Next Week
- Begin in app chatting feature (-6 days)
- Refine the interface
- Improve items and map interaction and integration (display uploaded items and link maps pins to items' page not just form)
- Write more integration tests (3 days)
- Research into notification pushing (2 days)
